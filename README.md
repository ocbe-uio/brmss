# brmss: Bayesian Regression Models using Spike-and-Slab Priors


This R-package **brmss** implements high-dimensional Bayesian linear and nonlinear regression models using independent spike-and-slab priors for full Bayesian inference. 
A general Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to sample the indicator variables of variable selection.
